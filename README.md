# ml-notes
This is my personal notes from all 5 courses of the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera by deeplearning.ai. The primary motivations for creating this document are to create a useful reference for myself and to solidify my understanding of concepts and algorithms. Chapters and sections generally correspond to courses and weeks in the Coursera sequence. 

My notes are in Latex. [main.pdf](deeplearning_notes/main.pdf) is the latest rendered pdf.
