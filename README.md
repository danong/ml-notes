# Machine Learning Notes
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/danong/ml-notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/danong/ml-notes)

**This is a work in progress**

This is my personal notes from all 5 courses of the [Deep Learning specialization on Coursera by deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The notes also include details from [Andrew Ng's original Machine Learning Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The primary motivations for creating this document are to create a useful reference for myself and to solidify my understanding of concepts and algorithms. Chapters and sections generally correspond to courses and weeks in the deeplearning.ai Coursera sequence. 

## Download
The latest rendered PDF can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/danong/ml-notes/releases/latest). I've configured Travis to only release the rendered PDF on tagged commits so the latest release may be out of date. If you want the absolute latest version, you can pull this repo and render the notes yourself.

## Credits
These notes are written in Latex and automatically rendered by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) using [rekka's docker image for tectonic](https://github.com/rekka/tectonic-docker). The latex template and commands are modified versions of [David Abel's notes template](https://github.com/david-abel/latex_docs). Python highlighting by [Olivier Verdier](https://github.com/olivierverdier/python-latex-highlighting).
